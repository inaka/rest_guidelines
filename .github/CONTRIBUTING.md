### Acceptance criteria

These are the rules we try to abide by at Inaka, we're just sticklers for the rules and consistency! We don't expect everyone to agree with them, we just want to share them in the hope that they will be useful to other teams.

Furthermore, we know for a fact that other teams go against some of these guidelines on purpose. :scream:

So obviously, we can't accept rules or guidelines which go against our way of doing things, because it would be disruptive for our team.
Aside from that, we are very open minded and willing to see and adopt new rules, especially if they have some fundament.

In general, we try to follow the community. We would be fools to ignore them.

So, to sum up, if you add some fundament or reasoning it'll be more likely to be accepted, even if it's just _"everyone else is doing it"_.
